Phrygian Étude for Distributed Version Control
by Ted Hayes & Sofy Yuditskaya

The Phrygian Étude is a "musical chain letter" experiment in PureData that is composed of YOUR commits!  So fork the Étude, modify the patch (following certain rules), and push it back to us.  When the time is ripe, we will then play back each stage of the composition—commit by commit—as a live performance!
